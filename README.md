# Referrals for Financial Success ðŸ¤‘

## Where are you storing your cash?
Put it in a high-yield savings account that offer >4% interest rates, a.k.a. APR ($1000 * 0.04 = free $40 every year)

Strategy:
1. Put in SoFi for 4.5% APR and set up direct deposit for free $300 - [CLICK HERE](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=2c19b7b4-0df5-40c2-8185-9588156aa644&isAliasGcp=false)
